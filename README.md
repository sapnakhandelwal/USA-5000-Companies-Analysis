# USA-5000-Companies-Analysis
Analysing the 5000 Companies of USA for Year 2014

Dataset - Given- This was my first project in R

Findings - 
1. Dataset was having 5000 rows and 19 columns
2. Few columns are having same information across all the rows. Hence not useful for the analysis purpose
3. Dataset was quite clean except one column 

Analysis -
1. I have done all basic Exploratory Analysis around the dataset
2. I have removed few columns which were not useful for the analysis purpose
3. I have created the Box plat and found IQR and remove the outliers
4. I have done Bivariate Analysis and created Bar Chart and found Correlaton Coefficient
